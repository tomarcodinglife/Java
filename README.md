# Java
Java is a high-level, object-oriented, platform-independent programming language used to build software applications. It was developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995 and is now maintained by Oracle.
## Why Java is Popular

### Platform Independent
Java follows the rule:
“Write Once, Run Anywhere”
A Java program can run on Windows, Linux, macOS, etc., without changes.

### Object-Oriented
Java is based on concepts like:
Class
Object
Inheritance
Polymorphism
Encapsulation
This makes programs reusable, modular, and easy to maintain.

### Secure
Java has:
No direct memory access
Bytecode verification
Automatic garbage collection

### Robust & Reliable
Strong memory management
Exception handling
Less chances of crashes

# JDK vs JVM VS JRE
JDK is a complete kit for Java developers. (JDK = JRE, Javac or Java Compiler, Development & Debugger) JVM is a virtual machine that runs Java programs. Using JVM Executes Java bytecode (.class files), Converts bytecode into machine code, Makes Java platform-independent, Manages memory and garbage collection and JRE provides the environment required to run Java applications. (JRE = JVM + Libraries)
